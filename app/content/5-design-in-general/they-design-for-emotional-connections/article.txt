> “Design is really an act of communication, which means having a deep understanding of the person with whom the designer is communicating.”
- Donald Norman has rightly said.

He identifies three levels of design that designers should incorporate to build emotions in their products. They are based on the way our brains work and result in a more appealing, effective, pleasurable design.

**Visceral design:** This focuses on the “look and feel” of the product. It works on our personality and cultural values and determines how we perceive something. A good visceral makes people happy and excited after seeing the product.
**Behavioural design:** This focuses on the “effectiveness of use”. According to Norman, appearance doesn’t matter, performance does. The good behavioral design has to be understandable and usable. The product needs to have the relevant functions to fulfil user needs.
**Reflective design:** considers the rationalization and intellectualization of a product. The reflective design defines our overall impression of a product since we reflect on all aspects of it: messages sent, cultural aspects, our upbringing, the meaning of the product and whether it’s worth remembering and made a part of our life.
So, the appearance of design defines visceral design. The behavioural level relates to how the product works, and the reflective level relates to the long-term impact of the design in our lives. By combining these three levels in the right way and balance, we can create a product that emotionally connects with the user at all levels.
