#UX design principles and full UX stack
The goals on each level of the UX design pyramid could be reached through following the main UX design principles:

#Hierarchy
Hierarchy is one of the designers’ best tools to help users move through a product easily. It includes:
Information Architecture (the way how content is organized across the app or site) and a
Visual Hierarchy (that help users navigate more easily within a section or a page).

#Consistency
In most cases, it could be reached by using a formal set of guidelines for how to design products for a particular device or format.
Confirmation
Require confirmation for any important or irreversible action to prevent errors user can accidentally make.

#User Control
‘Undo’, ‘back’, ‘search’ buttons, as well as keyboard shortcuts, are a great way to give a user the control over a website or an application.

#Accessibility
It’s crucial for the product to easy-to-use by as many people as possible. UX design should remove the obstacles for people when they use the product, whether those obstacles are temporary or more permanent.


UX design balances business, people and technology. While it is true that a product cannot succeed without a healthy business, a business cannot succeed without a happy customer— and it is the UX Designer’s job to make the customer happy.
