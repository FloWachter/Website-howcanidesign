####Use horizontal scroll in specific cases
Horizontal scroll works best when you want to display a subset of a category.
1. Displaying a large catalog of products or items so that different product categories can be easily shown

2. Displaying information in a large visual area that is not easy to see at a glance (e.g. a map)
3. Displaying discreet sections or slides of information on applications

####Show visually
Horizontal sites are not as intuitive to visitors as vertical sites which they see all day, every day. 
For mobiles, you have to do it differently. Your design must have a visual hint that a set of content is horizontally scrollable. The best way to do it is, letting a part of the scrollable content peek out!

####Positives of horizontal scroll
1. It is a design that is almost 100% consistent across all devices.
2. It is designed to allow space for secondary information, that doesn’t hog page space. For example when displaying images in a photo gallery, horizontal scrolling lets users see a small sample of the content and gives them the option to quickly ‘swipe’ or click for more.
3. Horizontal scrolling saves a lot of vertical screen space. Rather than displaying all the content at once on a very long page, horizontal layouts introduce users to smaller chunks of information. The layout is much more flexible. One can add content in both directions — vertical and horizontal.
4. Horizontal scrolling allows users to see options within a category by swiping to the side, or scrolling down to see different categories. This use of two dimensions helps users by showing a variety of options without making them visit separate category pages.
