- I collect photos, snaps of design (web, app, print—any source is fair game), color swatches, and typefaces specimens. During this R&D, I’m not just looking for things that are pretty, but for bits and pieces that might help me accomplish my project goals.
- As you collect bits and pieces for your mood board, take time to study each example for what works, and why you think it works.
- Mood boarding is even better with a team—get a big group of folks collecting to a shared area, leaving comments and collaborating on each new piece of inspiration. 
- During the design process, it’s like a style map you can go back and study any time you get lost along the way.
- During my design process, I study mood boards and design reference material much in the same way I do wireframes. While wireframes help direct my grid and user flow, a mood board helps direct my creativity with imagery, color, and reference.
- It’s also a great tool for onboarding new designers and team members

###A Moodboard contains:
- color palette
- fonts (1 to 3 per mood board)
- photography/illustration style
- iconography (if needed)
- navigation style
- spatial awareness (or, white space usage)
- overall contrast (helps emphasize hierarchy & structure)

- Mood boards don’t show the detailed picture of a future project. They are meant to transfer the right mood and bring the emotions expected from a product.
- Mood boards are useful tool helping designers effectively collaborate with clients and team members

##How to create a mood board
- Mood boards are a good way to experiment with a color palette, fonts, and style as well as plan visual hierarchy of a project. 

###Free collage
- A free college consisting of beautiful photos is an effective way to transfer a mood of the design concept. Also, collages can be filled with illustrations, fonts, and color examples.
- This type of mood boards is the fastest and the easiest among the others.

###Reference collection
- Another source of inspiration and a method for idea visualization is quality references. There are plenty resources such as Behance and Dribbble where designers can find inspiring concepts and real projects with a free access. 
- Collection of design works united by a common style or any other feature can easily illustrate an idea for a new project.

###Template board
- These mood boards are more like prototypes and wireframes. Their aim is to show the structure and visual hierarchy of a product
- Components are shown via random illustrations and photos presenting a layout of a digital product.
